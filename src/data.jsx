      "Ponte della Misericordia is a lovely and quiet spot to take nice photos. Yes, Venice is a fairly small island. But, I think you still need two days to explore the island. And this bridge at the back of the island is just perfect. I do recommend people to start their day early -- that is also the trick for most places, if you want to avoid the crowd.",

      "If you want to see the best view of Florence, I recommend going to Piazzale Michelangelo. The vibe at the plaza during sunset is also unbeatable. People gathering around the place watching the sunset together. Some people dancing and singing. You can walk down to the city after dawn, too. It was one of the highlights of my trip.",

      "The Leaning Tower of Pisa was a must side trip I had to do while visiting Florence. I have to admit that my main goal was to take a cool photo, and I must say that I am satisfied with the outcome. All credits to my beautiful friend Avi, though. Side note: I had the best pistachio gelato on my walk to the tower.",
