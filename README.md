# My Italy Travel Journal
Solo project assigned by Scrimba's Learn React for Free course.

This project basically let me practice the topics that were taught in the second section of the course which are bulding reusable components and using map to dynamically call the data from another page.

I uploaded some photos I took from my Italy trip in 2022 and described what struck me about those places, mainly photo oppotunities.
Besides getting to rpractice what I have learned, I also got to reminisce on my trip, too.
